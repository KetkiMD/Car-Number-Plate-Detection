OCR: Optimal Character Recognition

A Haar cascade is a machine learning-based object detection method that is used to detect specific patterns or objects in images. 
In this code, the Haar cascade XML file specified by harcascade is trained specifically for detecting Russian license plates. The Haar cascade XML file contains a set of classifiers that are trained to recognize certain features of license plates, such as edges, corners, or specific patterns. These classifiers are then used to scan an image or video frame and detect the presence of license plates.
