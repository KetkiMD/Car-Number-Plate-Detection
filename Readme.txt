Employ the OpenCV library to achieve real-time license plate detection by implementing a Haar Cascade classifier for precise plate identification. The code captures video feed from the default camera and processes every frame for the recognition of license plates.

To ensure accurate identification of license plates, the code utilizes a Haar cascade XML file specified by 'harcascade,' which is specifically trained for detecting Russian license plates. This XML file comprises a set of classifiers that have undergone training to recognize distinctive features of license plates, such as edges, corners, or specific patterns. During execution, these classifiers scan each frame of the input image or video to identify and locate license plates based on the learned patterns.

Fundamentally, the Haar cascade method represents a machine learning-based object detection technique crafted for recognizing predetermined patterns or objects in images. The designated XML file serves as a guide for the algorithm to identify Russian license plates by detecting pertinent features in the visual data.
